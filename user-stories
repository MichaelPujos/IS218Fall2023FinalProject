Epic (Awareness): Jake searches online for a "car dealership"  
Epic (Interest): Jake sees our website and is heavily interested in furthering his car research because of the usage of charts and seemingly reliable data (authority).
He also sees information about how our cars go to mechanics less often and stay on the road much longer (social proof/consistency).  
Epic (Action): Jake sees a link to sign up his email to get a limited data sheet about each car that he may be interested in also lets a salesperson get in contact with him.  
Epic (Loyalty): Jake sees a loyalty program once he signs up using his email that provides more information about the cars he's interested in as well as comparison charts to specific models from other competitors that he may be interested in.
