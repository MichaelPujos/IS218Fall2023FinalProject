Persona:
Jake is a data analyst living in Chicago. He's 29 years old and has a girlfriend that he wants to be more serious with.  
He has been looking into getting a new car to get around, having driven a hand-me-down from his parents since graduating college.  
He has recently gotten a big promotion at work to assistant manager and is making a lot more money than before.  
He always vets his big purchases carefully and looks at numbers, figures, and facts over flashy logos or promotions.
